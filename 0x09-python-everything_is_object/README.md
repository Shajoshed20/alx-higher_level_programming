# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## General Learning Objectives :heavy_check_mark:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions

## Requirements :flexed_biceps:

### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a newline character
* The first line of all your script files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

## **.txt** Answer Files
* Only one line
* No Shebang
* All your files should end with a new line

* Task 30 - Write a class LockedClass with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the </br> new instance attribute is called first_name.
* Task 31 - Assuming we are using a CPython implementation of Python3 with default options/configuration:
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (103-line1.txt)
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (103-line2.txt)

    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the first line of the script? (104-line1.txt)
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the second line of the script (104-line2.txt)
    - After the execution of line 3, is the int object pointed by a deleted? Answer with Yes or No (104-line3.txt)
    - After the execution of line 4, is the int object pointed by b deleted? Answer with Yes or No (104-line4.txt)
    - How many int objects are created by the execution of the last line of the script (104-line5.txt)
* Task 33 - [105-line1.txt](./105-line1.txt): Before the execution of line 2 in this script, how many `int` objects have been created and are still in memory?
* Task 34 - Clear Strings

    - [106-line3.txt](./106-line3.txt): After the execution of line 3, is the `str` object pointed to by `a` deleted?
    - [106-line4.txt](./106-line4.txt): After the execution of line 4, is the `str` object pointed to by `b` deleted?
    - [106-line5.txt](./106-line5.txt): How many `str` objects are created by the execution of the last line in this script?
