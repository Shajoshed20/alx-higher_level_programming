# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

## Background Context :frame_with_picture:

In this project, you will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

In the first part, you will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries.

In the second part, you will use the module SQLAlchemy (don’t ask me how to pronounce it…) an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”. You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

## General Learning Objectives

* Why Python programming is awesome
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* How to create a Python Virtual Environment

## Tasks

* Task 0 - Write a script that lists all states from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:
    - Your script should take 3 arguments: mysql username, mysql password and database name (no argument validation needed)
    - You must use the module MySQLdb (import MySQLdb)
    - Your script should connect to a MySQL server running on localhost at port 3306
    - Results must be sorted in ascending order by states.id
    - Results must be displayed as they are in the example below
    - Your code should not be executed when imported
