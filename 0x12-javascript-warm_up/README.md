# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Background Context :book:
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

* Scripting (same as we did with Python)
* Web front-end
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.


## General Learning Objectives :clipboard:

* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to run a JavaScript script
* How to create variables and constants
* What are differences between var, const and let
* What are all the data types available in JavaScript
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to affect values to variables
* How to use while and for loops
* How to use break and continue statements
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What does a function that does not use any return statement return
* Scope of variables
* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* How to manipulate dictionary
* How to import a file

## Tasks :scroll:

* Task 0 - Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:
    - You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var

* Task 1 - Write a script that prints 3 lines:
    - The first line: “C is fun”
    - The second line: “Python is cool”
    - The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var

* Task 2 - Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
    - If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
    - If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
    - Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var

* Task 3 - Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
    - If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var
    - You are not allowed to use length

* Task 4 - Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var

* Task 5 - Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:
    - If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var
    - You are not allowed to use try/catch

* Task 6 - Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop
    - The first line: “C is fun”
    - The second line: “Python is cool”
    - The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var
    - You are not allowed to use any if/else statement
    - You can use only one console.log
    - You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

* Task 7 - Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”
    - Where x is the first argument of the script
    - If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var
    - You can use only two console.log
    - You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

* Task 8 - Write a script that prints a square
    - The first argument is the size of the square
    - If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
    - You must use the character X to print the square
    - You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    - You are not allowed to use var
    - You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)
