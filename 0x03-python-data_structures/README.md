# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## General learning objectives :speech_balloon:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are lists and how to use them
* What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
* What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
* How to use lists as stacks and queues
* What are list comprehensions and how to use them
* What are tuples and how to use them
* When to use tuples versus lists
* What is a sequence
* What is tuple packing
* What is sequence unpacking
* What is the del statement and how to use it

## Tasks :page_with_curl:
* Task 0 - Write a function that prints all integers of a list
* Task 1 - Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
* Task 2 - Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
* Task 3 - Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
* Task 4 - Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
* Task 5 - Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
* Task 6 - Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
* Task 7 - Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
* Task 8 - Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
* Task 9 - Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
* Task 10 - Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
* Task 11 - Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
* Task 12 - Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
* Task 13 - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
* Task 14 - Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
