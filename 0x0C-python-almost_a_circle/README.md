# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## General Learning Objectives :heavy_check_mark:

* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Tasks :page_with_surl:

* Task 0 - All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
* Task 1 - Create a file named models/base.py:
    - Class Base:
        - private class attribute __nb_objects = 0
        - class constructor: def __init__(self, id=None)::
            - if id is not None, assign the public instance attribute id with this argument value - you can assume id is an integer and you donâ€™t need to test the type of it
            - otherwise, increment __nb_objects and assign the new value to the public instance attribute id
